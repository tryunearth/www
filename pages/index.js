          Hey, Cedric here, thanks for stopping by! I've been a Redditor for
          over eight years and throughout this time have amassed a collection of
          over 900 saved posts and comments. That's a lot of stuff to try and
          sift through.
        </p>

        <p className={styles.description}>
          Now, I love Reddit. Reddit is so much more than just a social
          platformâ€”it's a place to connect with like-minded individuals with
          similar interests, sure, but it's also a deep treasure trove of
          fascinating content just waiting to be discovered.
        </p>

        <p className={styles.description}>
          When I found out Reddit provides no tools to help manage or organize
          my saves, I became a little disheartened with the product.
          Unfortunately, I wasn't the only person who felt this way.
        </p>

        <p className={styles.description}>
          Inspired by what TweetDeck did for Twitter, I set out to create the
          most accessible and intuitive solution for managing and organizing
          Reddit saves.
        </p>

          Development of Unearth was and always will be driven by the following
          principles:
        </p>

        <p>You deserve to be able to save more than 1000 things.</p>
        <p>You deserve to be able to search your saved content.</p>
        <p>
          You deserve to be able to create tags and organize similar content.
        </p>
        <p>
          You deserve to be able to bulk delete saves and more easily manage
          your saved content.
        </p>
        <p>
          You deserve to be able to sort your saves by subreddit, author, and
          more to find exactly what you're looking for.
        </p>

        <p className={styles.description}>
          Gone are the days of mindlessly saving things and forgetting to look
          at it later. Unearth gives you the tools you need to get the most out
          of Reddit saves.
